# QuoridorEngine

Created by Giorgos Marmaras and Alexandros Kostas

A C# Quoridor Engine currently in development featuring a fully-fledged GUI and an AI agent able to play the game. The main goal of this project is to create generalized and fully reusable AI agents able to play any specified two-player adversarial game with minimal or no changes to the algorithms themselves. The board game Quoridor is used to demonstrate those algorithms in action. Ideally, the same AI Solvers can be used to play other similar games such as Tic-Tac-Toe or Chess as long as the game is described in a certain way to be able to communicate with the algorithm and provide it with the necessary data to make informed decisions. 

This README file will be updated accordingly once more details of the project are set in stone. Please refer to the latest version of the master branch to get the most recent edition of the project.
